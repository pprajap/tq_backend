# Contributing to TQ_SDK

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TQ_SDK! We appreciate your efforts to help improve our project. Please follow these standard practices to ensure a smooth contribution process:

## Standard Practices

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of the repository to work on your changes. This keeps the main repository clean and allows you to experiment freely.

2. **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `feature/add-newtonian-physics` or `bugfix/fix-gravity-bug`.

3. **Write Clear Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages. Think of it as explaining your changes to a physicist who just discovered quantum mechanics. 
Add some humor :P 
Why can't you trust an atom? Because they make up everything!
What did the physicist say when he found two isotopes of helium? HeHe.

1. **Code Style**: Follow the project's coding style guidelines. Consistency is key, much like the laws of physics.

2. **Testing**: Ensure your changes are well-tested. Remember, even Einstein tested his theories!

3. **Pull Request**: Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes. Include any relevant issue numbers. Think of your pull request as a scientific paperâ€”clear, detailed, and peer-reviewed.

By following these guidelines, you'll help us maintain a high standard of quality and ensure that our project remains stable and reliable. Thank you for your contributions!
