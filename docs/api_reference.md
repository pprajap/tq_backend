# API Reference

## POST /optimize

This endpoint performs optimization using the `TTOpt` class.

### Request Body

The request body should be a JSON object with the following fields:

- `dimensions` (int, optional): Number of function dimensions. Default is `100`.
- `lowerBound` (float, optional): Grid lower bound. Default is `-10.0`.
- `upperBound` (float, optional): Grid upper bound. Default is `10.0`.
- `gridSizeFactorP` (int, optional): The grid size factor (there will be `p^q` points). Default is `2`.
- `gridSizeFactorQ` (int, optional): The grid size factor (there will be `p^q` points). Default is `12`.
- `evals` (float, optional): Number of function evaluations. Default is `1.E+5`.
- `funcName` (string, optional): Name of the function to optimize. Default is `Simple`. Possible values are:
    - `Alpine`: \( f(x) = \sum |\sin(x) \cdot x + 0.1 \cdot x| \), \( x \in [-10, 10] \)
      ```python
      def f(X):
          return np.sum(np.abs(X * np.sin(X) + 0.1 * X), axis=1)
      ```
